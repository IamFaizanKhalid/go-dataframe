# go-dataframe
A simple package to abstract away the process of reading in a CSV file and converting it to a usable DataFrame.

# Generate DataFrame
The user specifies the path and filename of the CSV file they wish to read. They then call the CreateDataFrame function to read the CSV file, convert it to a DataFrame, and return both the DataFrame as well as the header names.
